<!--
Summary of data loaded for this query test suite:

1) MEL Type Deferred Fault: i.e. a fault that has deferral reference information
2) Fault without deferral reference information
3) Several deferral references defined with the same name but varied assemblies or operator assignments in order to be certain that
   the query is able to accurately select the correct deferral reference based on all uniquely identifying characteristics.

This test was introduced in OPER-10593.
